The story was designed to be experienced as it happened. It is currently unavailable for episodic replay like Season 2, so we've created a recap to inform you of the events that bridge the gap between the end of the Personal Story (circa 1325 AE) and Living World Season 2 (1327 AE).\n\nOnce you've completed the Season 1 recap, we encourage you to peruse the Season 2 catalog of playable episodes. Season 2 episodes are replayable, so once you've unlocked them on your account, you may play them as often as you like, whenever you want. You may enjoy the episodes for free by partying with another player who has them unlocked, or you may purchase them with gems so that you have full access to the associated achievements and rewards.",
